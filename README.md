steven's userscripts &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- targeting macOS Firefox and Safari (iOS too), but works on all platforms

### <u>Setup</u>

[<u>**Userscripts extension**</u>](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) (recommended): &nbsp; no setup required & works on iOS!

or using <u>**Tampermonkey**</u>: &nbsp; step 1, open config.user.js in the built-in editor and open the settings tab. Set the position to 1, and "run at" to document-start.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; step 2 (<u>**OPTIONAL) + (Firefox ONLY**</u>): &nbsp; host this folder as http://localhost/userscripts (port 80) with any web server and import tampermonkey-export.zip (allows you to use "git pull" to live patch updates from this GitHub; edit these userscripts from your filesystem / favorite editor)
